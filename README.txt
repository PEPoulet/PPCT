# Prediction Powered Inference for Clinical Trials

This repository contains the code to reproduce experiments in the paper entitled "Prediction Powered Inference for Clinical Trials".

Contents : 
- ``ad_ct_simulations.R`` is an R script using the ``adsim`` package that can be downloaded here with all useful information on how to run it: https://bitbucket.org/metrumrg/alzheimers-disease-progression-model-adascog/src/master/ . This script generates all the data used in the simulation experiments
- ``estimators.py`` is the Python module containing the code to compute the estimators introduced in the paper
- ``PPCT_simulations.ipynb`` is the Python notebook running all the simulations experiments. It requires the data to already have been generated by the R script
- ``PPCT_hippocampe.ipynb`` is the Python notebook running the experiments on the hippocampus study, which requires the clinical trial data and the ADNI data (adni.loni.usc.edu) to train the models. Model parameters / predictions can be directly asked to the authors of the paper if needed
